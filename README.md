## Get started
- Run `npm run install`.
- Run `npm run dev`.

## Dedication
<p align="center">Potatoes, potatoes! They grow in the ground,</p>

<p align="center">When you dig them up they're muddy, brown and round,</p>

<p align="center">Potatoes, potatoes! Delicious mashed,</p>

<p align="center">But they don't taste so good if they've been bashed,</p>

<p align="center">Potatoes, potatoes! Steamy in their jacket,</p>

<p align="center">Potatoes, potatoes! Fresh in their packet,</p>

<p align="center">Potatoes, potatoes! Can be made into chips,</p>

<p align="center">Potatoes, potatoes! Are best when they're crisps!</p>
